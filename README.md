## Rules
Using  the  Java  programming  language,  implement  DESCRIPTIVE-STATISTICS  from scratch.  This  means,  apart  from  the  functions  related  to  input  and  output  and  basic  arithmetic,  an  implementation  of  DESCRIPTIVE-STATISTICS  should  notmake  use  of  any  reuse  mechanism  (such  as  built-in  functions,  libraries,  or  APIs)  provided  natively  by  the  programming  language  or  otherwise.  This  may  lead  to  recursive  implementation  of  certain  primary  functions,  the  result  of  which  would  be secondary functions. 


## Description
The purpose of descriptive statistics is to quantitatively describe a collection of data. Let x  be  a  random  variable  that  can  take  values  from  a  finite  data  set  x1, x2, x3,  ...,  xn, with each value having the same probability. The minimum,  m,  is  the  smallest  of  the  values  in  the  given  data  set.  (m  need  not  be  unique.) The maximum,  M,  is  the  largest  of  the  values  in  the  given  data  set.  (M  need  not  be  unique.) The mode, o, is the value that appears most frequently in the given data set. (o need not be unique.) The median, d, is the middle number if n is odd, and is the arithmetic mean of the two middle numbers if n is even.The arithmetic mean, μ,The mean absolute deviation, MAD, The standard deviation, σ,

Let  there  be  a  system,  called  DESCRIPTIVE-STATISTICS,  for  finding  m,  M,  o,  d,  μ, MAD, and σ. The system should take as input a random number of data values and output its descriptive statistics.
